    "summary": "Variables are containers that store data values. Think of them like labeled boxes where you can put information and use it later. Variables allow you to reuse values without typing them repeatedly. You give each variable a name, assign a value to it, and then reference it by name whenever you need that value.",

    "summary": "Loops are programming structures that let you repeat an action or block of code multiple times automatically. Instead of writing the same code over and over, you write it once and tell the loop how many times to execute it or until a condition is met. There are different types of loops like for loops and while loops.",

Instead of writing the same logic repeatedly throughout your program, you write it once in a function and call it whenever you need it. Functions can take inputs called parameters and return outputs called return values.",

Common conditional statements are if, else if, and else. They help your program behave differently depending on the data it receives.",

    "summary": "Arrays are data structures that store multiple values of the same type in a single variable. Instead of creating separate variables for each item, you can group related items in an array. You access each item using an index number, starting from zero. Arrays are useful for storing lists of data like students, scores, or product names.",
